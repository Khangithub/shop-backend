# download
  open command prompt\
  `git clone https://github.com/Khangithub/shop-backend.git` \
  `cd shop-backend` \
  `yarn start`
# take note
  if it causes `Application error` or requires `heroku logs --tail`, please patiently reload the page once or twice, \
  i put the database and the server to cloud so it maybe crashed because of `request timeout` at the very beginning
